# TODOs:

- https://github.com/Games-and-Simulations/sc-docker/issues/21 Automatically check host permissions.
- Play against in-game AI
- Play on multiple computers
- Launch game, and bots can connect to it repeatedly (save time for repeated plays)
- Support for singularity containers
- Sound support (ALSA) for human player
- Copy crash files from SC folder outside (java crashes are in Z:\app\sc\hs_err_pid8.log)
- Try to make the docker image smaller
