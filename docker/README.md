You should put your version of JRE here.
Latest version of JRE could be found on [Oracle website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)

Please download Windows x86 version and place it in this folder.

Image `java.dockerfile` uses the `jre-8u161-windows-i586.tar.gz` version.

I don't put the JRE directly in the repo because of potential license problems.
